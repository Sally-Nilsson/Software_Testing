To run the program you open the pickle_run_tests.ipynb and run all cells. This will create 2 folders with all the tests that we tested and made a json file for each.
Then a comparasson is made when the file "pickle_testing False" is runed. The False or True attribute is if the code should compare the files or create the test files. 

*OBS* : WSL needs to be downloaded to run.
